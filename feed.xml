        <title>How to change your life, forever</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;As I work,&lt;/span&gt;  an open letter envelope lies on my desk. &lt;!--more--&gt;
It is full of small folded pieces of paper, containing messages from friends.
“I am glad you were part of this” one recites. “Thanks for listening to me” another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how I got them, and about what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-one-week-long-mba&quot;&gt;A “One-week long MBA”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania is a country that does not generally enjoy a great reputation here in Italy. Once a man told me he firmly believed that “Romanian immigrants brought smallpox into Italy”. Although not all so extreme, Italians might suffer from - consciously or unconsciously - stereotypes about Romanians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, when some months ago I announced a one week trip to Romania, I was met with some confused stares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I had a very good reason for visiting: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspireacademy.ro/&quot;&gt;Aspire&lt;/a&gt;, “the only academy in Eastern Europe where Harvard and Stanford professors teach and inspire”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had applied for their flagship program: Aspire Academy, a “one-week long MBA”, as Alex Radu, one of Aspire Academy’s speakers, described it, and I was in fervent anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Aspire, me and other 50 selected international students and young professionals were going to be exposed to a tight series of lectures, workshops and activities on themes such as leadership, entrepreneurship, communication and personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/steve_jardin.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;maincolumn-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/internships-careers/research-assistant-program/professor-steve-jarding&quot;&gt;Prof. Steve Jardin&lt;/a&gt; was one of the &amp;#8220;big stars&amp;#8221; of the event. His incredible teaching never failed to mesmerize students and attract many questions, as shown here, in an after-class shot.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although all of this sounded enticing, what made my board that plane weren’t the lectures (or the 5-star resort in the hearth of the Carpathians where Aspire took place), but rather the impressive word of mouth I had received by Aspire Alumni in the months before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticeably, people talked of a “life before and after Aspire”, and often mentioned the impact of the program on their personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I believe Aspire is actually engineered to shake up life from drifting into the inertia-bound path it usually tends to follow. Behind the scenes, every minute is somehow orchestrated in order to create the perfect ground for a personal blossoming. The very air that breaths in Aspire is imbued with some sort of magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-ones-star-in-the-black-of-night&quot;&gt;Finding one’s star in the black of night&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When participating in Aspire, this July and August, I had the chance to see some of the mechanisms of the “Aspire Effect” in action. One of them is the True North Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, Aspire is all about deciding what to do with your life. And True North Groups are precisely the right tool for this goal. As Paul Graham said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html&quot;&gt;“The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these problems with a hard core.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill George, the inventor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.billgeorge.org/true-north-groups/&quot;&gt;True North Groups&lt;/a&gt; and professor at Harvard Business School, understood that and created True North Groups with this fact in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the direction of one’s life is probably the hardest decision that any individual has to make every day. For this reason, you can’t really go it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aspire organizers created True North Groups so that you and a few carefully selected others will form an intimate group that acts as a safe space where to share in-depth discussions about your life, past and future. The whole idea is to bring your past life choices, motivation and values out in the light, as to increase your own awareness of them as well as to let external observers provide helpful guidance and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/mihai_antonia.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;maincolumn-figure&quot;&gt;Our True Norh Star group members were selected based on their background and life ambitions, in order to create a circle of similar but heterogeneous people&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True North Group sessions take place at night, in a quiet and separate hotel area, where, in front of a glass of wine, each member has the total and complete attention of the other members as they speak about their life. And at that moment, someone who a moment before was just a classmate, a half-stranger, lets your gaze roam free in the innermost structures of their persona. As in an open anatomy book, each member points at masks, bleeding wounds, unexplained emotions: in an almost vertiginous experience you feel transplanted in someone else’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That moment is when your own life is invested by a clear, straight light, allowing a common experience of insight to materialize among the members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure many solemn resolutions were taken in those nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-true-european-nation-with-a-twist&quot;&gt;A true European nation, with a twist.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another piece of machinery responsible for the transformative power of the event came from the fact that, although international at the core, Aspire did not take place in some huge frenetic hub as London or New York. &lt;br /&gt;
Aspire took place in Romania, a singularity of a country of Latin language and background, among Slavic neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, the young Romanians I met were imbued with the many contradictions of their nation and soon learned to accept and thrive in instability and uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;
Stubborn and optimistic, they often mix American ambition with the bluntness so typical of their home country, creating upright personalities capable of being equally shocking and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Soare&quot;&gt;Anastasia Soare&lt;/a&gt;, Romanian born US billionaire, participating via Zoom, who got asked by a student how would she have handled insuccess. “What if I fail?” she answered without hesitation “I don’t care, I’d do it anyway!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/attitude.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;maincolumn-figure&quot;&gt;A positive attitude was shared by students as well.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her attitude was matched only by her host, Alex Radu, a successful Harvard graduate working in Goldman Sachs. Alex suggested a radical attitude when dealing with oneself. He presented an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hfi.com/articles/work-behavior-explained&quot;&gt;“onion” model of personality&lt;/a&gt;, where some aspects of the self, such as the way we present ourselves to others, are positioned more externally compared to more internal and subconscious aspects, as our beliefs on how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our beliefs about ourselves too, are especially critical in this theory since they might deeply influence our decisions without our direct knowledge. “I am a lazy person”, “I give up”, “I get discouraged easily”, these are all examples of beliefs. They sit internally at the core of who we are and end up having a critical influence on our behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Radu suggests treating your beliefs like you treat your clothes: choose the one you like, discard or change the other for new ones. “Find your dysfunctional beliefs, extract them and implant new ones in their place”. Although provocative, his message surely invites us to reflect on the usefulness and artificial nature of our beliefs, and on the ultimate power of human decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-romanians&quot;&gt;On Romanians&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania is often an underlooked country, that for many is only associated with communism dread and poverty. I wonder if Romanians who travelled abroad developed a thick skin in response to these stereotypes, as they often appear to speak and act with attitude and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When investigating this sort of personality trait with a Romanian friend of mine, he confessed that he felt as “there’s a time for self-doubt, and a time for play. When you are in the game, play: don’t undermine yourself”. Don’t show your cards, keep up the act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last rule must prove most useful in Romania itself, a country where there’s a competition for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a hard time finding someone in Aspire who did not compete - and win - in some sort of local or national competition. Debate, mathematics, programming, even history and geography, you name it. It is very common to meet Romanians working on two jobs, studying and working, working on side hustles, or attending two universities at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitive and “American” attitude is palpable and is no wonder that the rich curricula this work culture produces are well regarded by companies abroad. This is also facilitated by the baffling speed at which Romanians are able to learn languages: not a single person I met spoke less than 3 languages. This can be partially explained by the Latin roots of the Romanian language and by the fact that Romanians are exposed to foreign tongues such as English and French since their young age through television, media ads and schooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-different-perspective&quot;&gt;A different perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the Romanians’ attitude towards work, you would expect a negative correlation with fun. &lt;br /&gt;
Surprisingly, that is not the case. “Romanians learn to party, dance and have fun at a young age, around 15 - 16” tells me Val, a microbiology student from Montreal, back in Romania for the summer period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partying is considered a normal, physiological activity, to the point that high school balls are organized by the school itself and hosted inside clubs, drinks included. Indeed, Young Romanians enjoy relative freedom from parental restriction in terms of partying and have early experience with nightlife. Consequently, when teens reach adult age, they don’t feel the urge to bridge drink or party the house down. In a sense, this sort of “Romanian early partying tradition” might be helpful in lifting the taboo around alcohol and nightlife, making it less of a secret pleasure, and therefore less dangerous for boys and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/party.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;maincolumn-figure&quot;&gt;Partying was an integral part of the Aspire curriculum&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised when I came to Canada” she said, “how everybody was bridge-drinking and getting wasted like it was a cool thing”. “In Romania, we do that in high school, then we get over it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked her more about the hyper-competitive Romanian high school experience. “I did not like going to school, I had bad grades” she confessed to me. “School was keeping me away from the things I really wanted to do: go out, meet people, manage my projects and follow my goals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these statements did not make any sense to me: in my mindset, only serious and total dedication to school work would win you a position at any “good” university. Val was actually proclaiming the opposite, in an almost rebellious stance. She continued: “I had to prepare for my SLS exams so I did not really pay attention to my A levels. My professors knew that and were irritated but could not really fail me, as they knew I was a good student after all”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people I met there defined this strategy the “Romanian way”: don’t work to be the best in the class, but to reach your goals.&lt;br /&gt;
“I had to learn how to cut corners”. “Break the rules”, she added, “try many things to discover what you like.” This mindset surpassed her own expectations as she founded an AI &amp;amp; Biotech startup in Montreal and found a part-time job on another one, while being a full-time student. &lt;label for=&quot;three&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;three&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;A perfect example of the Romanian work culture I encountered. &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, her message carried a huge meaning as it was in total rupture with what most Italian high schoolers are supposed to do and think. In my environment, school is more similar to a punishing institution which goal is to trap students in a sequence of ever-increasingly difficult tests. I find the whole projectual and self-discovery focus Val had totally missing here in Italy, where personal extracurricular goals are considered distractions and are not encouraged by teachers in any way. But, more than that, what really sets apart her approach is the relative weight given to school compared to other professional or academic achievements.&lt;br /&gt;
School is not the only and absolute judge of your future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-leaders-face-change&quot;&gt;How leaders face change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in a metamorphosis, at Aspire you are most likely to be turned inside out: your beliefs about who you are, how you function, your own life story, Aspire is a time of self-understanding and “self reprogramming” &lt;label for=&quot;two&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;two&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/430816076490a3ddfc3fe1.pdf&quot;&gt;Psychology of Life Stories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason for the title of this article. Aspire is a school of change disguised as a leadership program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Goleman speaks of leaders as extraordinary individuals who can focus on the future and prepare the present for its coming. To predict, adapt and ride the waves of time, any leader needs to be a master of (self) change. &lt;label for=&quot;three&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;three&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Focus, the hidden driver of excellence &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And changing ourselves is arguably the hardest possible challenge that we might face in life. As Brianna Weist said, the world, as well as the individual, is plagued with “big, ongoing and seemingly unsurmountable issues”. Climate disaster, obesity, addiction. And yet the solutions seem “so simple and yet so impossible to stick with”: stop smoking, exercise less, cut carbon emissions etc… &lt;label for=&quot;two&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;two&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/430816076490a3ddfc3fe1.pdf&quot;&gt;The Mountain Is You, Brianna Weist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most absurd paradox psychologists face: if only they could make people exercise a little more, smoke and drink a little less, the global impact on the health system would be measured in billions. And yet, such small changes are so hard that people “seem to change only when not changing seems the less comfortable option”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is extremely hard, and this might be the reason why only leaders succeed in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-keep-changing-your-life&quot;&gt;How to keep changing your life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/graduate.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;maincolumn-figure&quot;&gt;Graduation day&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day at Aspire, we all grouped and prepared for the last salutations. Some of us might have parted ways forever, while others might have seen the sprouting of new long-lasting friendships. We took the chance to share short messages of goodbye, placed in named envelopes which we would carry with us on our journey outside Aspire. I believe these messages might be the last card in Aspire’s masterful game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aspire is a concentrated emotional thunderstorm, meant to shake and uproot some parts of yourself. Only the centrifugal energy of the moment, the atmosphere, the people, the conversations and smiles can imprint the first step of change. Not only in your belief, but in your heart as well. Nonetheless, this power fades in time as life takes over again, as a barren volcanic island swallowed back in by the sea after a brief eruption. For this reason, Aspire infects its participants by attaching a living, beating peace of the event to them. These messages work as a memory trigger and bring back the reader to those days, and in doing so, to the emotional wiring reconfiguration the brain experienced in that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we navigate in the wider, non-sensational, often colourless daily grind, only the determination, focus and strength of the leader can keep the rudder straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aspire is just a metaphor, an inspiration, on what it means to exist across events, across days, across emotions, and carve one’s straight line in life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The sad but true reality of professional Psychology in Italy: the most hated job is also the most profitable</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;The truth students should learn before enrolling in a Psychology Degree.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while I have been pointing out at some elephants in the room of professional Psychology in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who missed on my continuous rants, here is a short breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; There is a critical overabundance of psychologists. In 2018 (3 years ago), there were a staggering 109.524 certified psychologists on the Italian peninsula, with the number of non certified practitioners way higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; The market demand cannot provide a sufficient income to sustain all these professionals. On average, 1 in 2 psychologists earn somewhere around 9.000€ per year, which is around 750€ per month. More worryingly, 1 in 10 psychologists earn less than 500€ per year. Overall, it is safe to say that the majority of psychologists earn less than a minimum-wage pay would grant then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; Most devilishly, certified Psychologists often earn by certifying other psychologists, generating a downward spiral in the profession. To expalin:&lt;br /&gt;
A psychology student in Italy must possess a minimum of 5 year of university studies, and must work for another certified psychologist (often for free) for a whole year in training before passing a final abilitating exam and be considered a psychologist.&lt;br /&gt;
On top of that, to become a psychotherapist, psychologists must often spend additional 2–5 years in training from another trained psychotherapist (see a trend here?).&lt;br /&gt;
All these certifications (often not enough to be competitive on the market when considering that the majority of psychologists have them) are quite expensive and require constant and dedicated effort of our young workforce.&lt;br /&gt;
This results in a proliferation of expensive schools, masters, seminars and webinars of dubious utility, that further delay the training of the psychologists, and further drain their short finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury, there is a small but emergent area in psychology which seems to have better luck: marketing and communication psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ENPAP report of 2018 shows how psychologists who work in marketing and communication grossed the highest in the profession, as much as 1.8 times more money on average than clinical psychologists. The number goes even higher when comparing the average revenue of marketing psychology to the one of school psychologists, the former grossing two times and a half more money on average than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/psychology_job/table.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;maincolumn-figure&quot;&gt;Frequency of each job title (&amp;#8220;Numero&amp;#8221;), and average yearly pay (&amp;#8220;Media Reddito netto&amp;#8221;). Marketing Psychology is &amp;#8220;Marketing &amp;amp; Comunicazione&amp;#8221;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the funny part: only the 0.002% of psychologists are marketing and communication psychologists. Yea, you read well, that number is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that a dominating majority of psychologists loath marketing psychology, considering it a profession of tricksters who use the knowledge obtained from psychology courses to fool people into buying stuff they don’t really need. As a consequence, most young students steer away from manuals in communication, perception and social psychology.
I still remember the &lt;em&gt;“Ehw, why would you do that?”&lt;/em&gt; reaction that I got when telling other colleagues of my decision to work in the field of marketing and applied psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pity, not only considering that there is a huge need for trained and effective marketing psychologists in the market, (that 0.002% means that there is space for way more professionals in the field), but also that most marketing psychologists I know could not be further from the “evil trickester” stereotype.&lt;br /&gt;
Take, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiarabacilieri/&quot;&gt;Chiara Bacilieri&lt;/a&gt;, a young marketing psychologist and manager who, among many other things, works at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/lifebasedvalue/about/&quot;&gt;Lifeed&lt;/a&gt;, a company promoting workers’ well being using psychology and Big Data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is for the next generation of young Italians to see the numbers above &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; making their decision of going into psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than that, I wish to remind all psychologists, young and old, that psychology is a flexible discipline which can find applications in the most disparate of fields. In fact, I believe that professionals who “stick their head out” and apply psychology to new and emerging fields will be the ones that will innovate (and profit) the most in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, professional psychology need not to become an elite, but could be more aware of its limitations, especially when making promises to young students.&lt;/p&gt;
