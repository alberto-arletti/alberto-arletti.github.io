{% newthought 'Try out some new stuff' %} of this cool theme. <!--more-->

#### Jekyll customizations

[here](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css)
*Liquid*


```
np.unique(df['data_1'])
```

Any of these values can be changed in the ```df['data_1'].value_counts()``` file before the site is built. The default values are the ones from *tufte-css*.

Tufte CSS uses ```<h1>``` for the document title, ```<p>``` with class ```code``` for the document subtitle, ```<h2>``` for section headings, and ```<h3>``` for low-level headings.

{% newthought 'In his later books' %}{% sidenote 'two' '[http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be)'%}, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and sets the first few words of the sentence in small caps. To accomplish this using this style, enclose the sentence fragment you want styled with small caps in a custom Liquid tag called 'newthought' like so:

```Liquid
{{ "{% newthought 'In his later books'" }} %}


<h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>

{% epigraph 'Se ti gratti le palle e ne senti due di troppo> fermai, potresti star facendo il gioco di chi ti è dietro' 'Alessandro Candiracci' '2021' %}


If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. The two examples above show how they are styled. Epigraph elements are modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly *Beautiful Evidence*). The [Tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) gitub repository has detailed instructions on how to achieve this using HTML elements. As an easier alternative, the *Tufte-jekyll* theme uses custom *Liquid tag* pairs that allow the writer to embed elements such as epigraphs in the middle of the regular Markdown text being edited.

In order to use an epigraph in a page or section, type this:

```{{ "{% epigraph 'text of citation' 'author of citation' 'citation source' "}} %}```

to produce this:

{% epigraph 'I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.' 'Henri Matisse' 'Henri Matisse Dessins: thèmes et variations, 1943' %}

{% epigraph  ' "How did you go bankrupt?" Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.' 'Ernest Hemingway' ' "The Sun Also Rises" '%}

### Lists

Tufte points out that while lists have valid uses, they tend to promote ineffective writing habits due to their “lack of syntactic and intellectual discipline”. He is particularly critical of hierarchical and bullet-pointed lists. So before reaching for an HTML list element, ask yourself:

* Does this list actually have to be represented using an HTML ul or ol element?
* Would my idea be better expressed as sentences in paragraphs?
* Is my message causally complex enough to warrant a flow diagram instead?
* lol
* another one


{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/rhino.png' 'F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zoological Literature,” *Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice* (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s *Visual Explanations*.'  %}

Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte’s work. To place figures in the margin, use the custom margin figure liquid tag included in the ```_plugins``` directory like so:

```{{ "{% marginfigure 'mf-id-whatever' 'assets/img/rhino.png' 'F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zoological Literature,” *Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice* (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s *Visual Explanations*.' "}} %}```.

Note that this tag has *three* parameters. The first is an arbitrary id. This parameter can be named anything as long as it is unique to this post. The second parameter is the path to the image. And the final parameter is whatever caption you want to be displayed with the figure.  All parameters *must* be enclosed in quotes for this simple liquid tag to work!

In this example, the *Liquid* marginfigure tag was inserted *before* the paragraph so that it aligns with the beginning of the paragraph. On small screens, the image will collapse into a small symbol: <span class="contrast ">&#8853;</span> at the location it has been inserted in the manuscript. Clicking on it will open the image.

### Full Width Figures

If you need a full-width image or figure, another custom liquid tag is available to use. Oddly enough, it is named 'fullwidth', and this markup:

```{{ "{% fullwidth 'assets/img/napoleons-march.png' 'Napoleon's March *(Edward Tufte’s English translation)*' "}} %}```

Yields this:

{% fullwidth 'assets/img/napoleons-march.png' "Napoleon's March *(Edward Tufte’s English translation)*" %}


### Main Column Figures

Besides margin and full width figures, you can of course also include figures constrained to the main column. Yes, you guessed it, a custom liquid tag rides to the rescue once again:

```{{ "{% maincolumn 'assets/img/export-imports.png' 'From Edward Tufte, *Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, page 92' "}} %}```

yields this:

{% maincolumn "assets/img/exports-imports.png" "From Edward Tufte, *Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, page 92" %}
